    "## 8.1 The case for convolutions\n",
    "In this section, we’ll see how convolutions deliver locality and translation invariance.\n",
    "We’ll do so by taking a close look at the formula defining convolutions and applying it\n",
    "using pen and paper—but don’t worry, the gist will be in pictures, not formulas.\n",
    "We said earlier that taking a 1D view of our input image and multiplying it by an\n",
    "`n_output_features × n_input_features` weight matrix, as is done in `nn.Linear` ,\n",
    "means for each channel in the image, computing a weighted sum of all the pixels multiplied by a set of weights, one per output feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also said that, if we want to recognize patterns corresponding to objects, like an\n",
    "airplane in the sky, we will likely need to look at how nearby pixels are arranged, and\n",
    "we will be less interested in how pixels that are far from each other appear in combination. Essentially, it doesn’t matter if our image of a Spitfire has a tree or cloud or kite in the corner or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to translate this intuition into mathematical form, we could compute the\n",
    "weighted sum of a pixel with its immediate neighbors, rather than with all other pixels\n",
    "in the image. This would be equivalent to building weight matrices, one per output\n",
    "feature and output pixel location, in which all weights beyond a certain distance from\n",
    "a center pixel are zero. This will still be a weighted sum: that is, a linear operation."

    "### 8.1.1 What convolutions do\n",
    "We identified one more desired property earlier: we would like these localized patterns\n",
    "to have an effect on the output regardless of their location in the image: that is, to be\n",
    "translation invariant. To achieve this goal in a matrix applied to the image-as-a-vector we\n",
    "used in chapter 7 would require implementing a rather complicated pattern of weights\n",
    "(don’t worry if it is too complicated; it’ll get better shortly): most of the weight matrix\n",
    "would be zero (for entries corresponding to input pixels too far away from the output\n",
    "pixel to have an influence). For other weights, we would have to find a way to keep\n",
    "entries in sync that correspond to the same relative position of input and output pixels.\n",
    "This means we would need to initialize them to the same values and ensure that all these\n",
    "tied weights stayed the same while the network is updated during training. This way, we\n",
    "would ensure that weights operate in neighborhoods to respond to local patterns, and\n",
    "local patterns are identified no matter where they occur in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this approach is more than impractical. Fortunately, there is a readily\n",
    "available, local, translation-invariant linear operation on the image: a `convolution`. We\n",

    "to describe is exactly what we just delineated—only taken from a different angle.\n",
    "\n",
